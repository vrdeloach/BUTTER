Jackson's Charity Basketball League
===================================

  JCBL began in the summer of 2015 at Westwood Recreational Center when the city of Jackson wanted to have more of an incentive for the community to do more charitable work. The JCBL has accomplished a lot since it was created, and has raised a great deal of money that has been put toward many charity organizations. The JCBL's goal is to encourage as much participation to help the community as they possibly can. This website was created prior to the third season of the league, and we hope to enjoy many more seasons of giving back to our society.

Our Website
============

  This website was created by Brandon Mingledorff and Gabriel Storm because the JCBL did not have one previously. Our goal was to direct more attention towards the league, to create an easier way for people to join, and to raise awareness for the charities that we support.
  
Our website has many features such as:

  - Fully responsive with several media queries to adjust the look and feel of the website depending on what device you are viewing it on

  - We have a beautiful, responsive contact form that notifies you as to whether or not your message was able to send
  
  - There is an interactive embedded Google Map showing the location of the Westwood Recreational Center
  
  - On the FAQ's page we have a lovely dropdown menu in order to reduce the amount of initial content on the page so that the viewer does not feel overwhelmed
  
  - The table on the schedule page is uniquely responsive as it will put the column headers to the left of the row information and make it much easier to read on a mobile device. Our table also highlights rows when you hover over them to aid in reading them
  
  - Our menu bar does not scroll up with the page so you can access it no matter where you are on the page
  
  - The charity page has links to all of the charities that are supported by the JCBL
  
  - On the about page we have a attractive, responsive slideshow that includes pictures of the JCBL in action
  
  - We have a footer on each page that includes navigation links as well as a phone and email link
  
  - Our website has a custom made favicon that we designed and implemented ourselves
  
  - We also have a custom logo that we created ourselves
  
  - We appreciate you taking the time to go over our website!
