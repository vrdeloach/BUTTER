    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p>Below are some questions we get asked often, so we hope these clear up the confusion if there is any, but please don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for further information or clarification! </p>

    <button class="accordion">How do the donations work?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The percentage or amount of money donated to each charity is determined by the overall size and turnout of an event, tournament, or game. At least 75% of all revenue generated will go to charities, but the majority of the time, that figure stands at close to 100%. Basically, the more people that participate, and the more the word gets out, the more we help our charities!</p>
</div>
  
  <button class="accordion">Can I make a direct donation to the league?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When you arrive at a JCBL game, admission costs $5 per person, but you can choose to donate even more if you'd like! Every contribution helps, and the more people that participate in our games and charity events, the faster we achieve our goals! 100% of ticket revenue goes to charity.</p>
</div>
  
  <button class="accordion">Do I have to be involved with a charity before I sign up?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You do not have to be previously involved with a non-profit to play in the league. After all, the purpose of JCBL is to get more people involved in a good cause! We hope that once you sign up, if you had no prior knowledge of Jackson-area or even national charities, you will after playing.</p>
</div>

  <button class="accordion">Are there any fees for joining?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Currently, it is $100 to register a team of up to 10 people ($10 per player) or $20 to register as a "free agent," which means you will be placed on a team with any open spots. All of the money from registrations goes to charities!</p>
</div>
  
  <button class="accordion">How many games are in a season?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In the regular season, each team plays 12 games. After the regular season, a tournament is played amongst all teams in single-elimination games until a champion is crowned. The first round of the tournament pits the team with the worst record against the team with the best record, the second worst record against the second best, and so on (NBA playoff style).</p>
</div>
  
  <button class="accordion">When does the season start, and how long does it last?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Each season starts in the spring around early May, and the regular season lasts until the first week of August. The tournament is played the week after the regular season ends.  </p>
</div>
  
  <button class="accordion">How long is each game?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Every game lasts for 32 minutes of total play time, or 4 quarters of 8 minutes.</p>
</div>
  
   <button class="accordion">Is every game at Westwood?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Every game is at Westwood Recreational Center unless it is stated otherwise on the <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</p>
</div>
  
  <button class="accordion">Can I sponsor a team?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We are currently planning a team sponsorship system, but as of now there is none in place. You can, however, donate to the league itself and we will recognize you or your business/organization on a game flyer and even the JCBL website.</p>
